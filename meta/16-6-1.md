computation_calculations: "This product is based on data from the Canadian Centre for Justice and Community Safety Statistics (CCJS) Corrections Key Indicator Report for Adults. Fiscal year (April 1 through March 31). Due to rounding, figures may not add to totals. These data are administrative data. Although the Corrections Key Indicator Report attempts to standardize the way in which data are reported, limitations due to differences among jurisdictional operations may restrict uniform application of the definitions in some situations. For this reason, inter-jurisdictional comparisons of the data should be made with caution."
