national_indicator_available: 'Prevalence of asset resilience'
target_name: 'No target'
national_indicator_description: "Asset resilience is defined as having enough savings to maintain well-being for a specified period of time. More specifically, the ability of Canadians to cover unexpected expenses, or reduced income, by drawing from assets (e.g. a bank account) for a specified period of time."
national_geographical_coverage: 'Canada, Province or territory' 
computation_calculations: "Low income measures (LIM), are relative measures of low income, set at 50% of adjusted median household income. These measures are categorized according to the number of persons present in the household, reflecting the economies of scale inherent in household size. The LIM are based on after-tax income (AT). Liquid financial assets include bank accounts, term deposits, treasury bills, tax-free savings accounts, stocks and bonds (in mutual funds or not), and registered retirement savings plans. Economic family types are comprised of economic families (a group of two or more persons who live in the same dwelling and are related to each other by blood, marriage, common law or adoption) and persons not in an economic family (a person living either alone or with others to whom he or she is unrelated)."
comments_limitations:
rationale_interpretation: 'Liquid financial assets can provide some relief for families faced with a disruption to their primary source of income, so they can continue to meet their essential needs and financial obligations. Therefore, families with lower liquid financial assets may be more vulnerable to a disruption in income than families with higher liquid financial assets.'
