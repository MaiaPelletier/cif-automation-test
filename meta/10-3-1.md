national_indicator_description: "The gender wage ratio can be interpreted as the proportion of a dollar that women earn for every dollar earned by men."
national_geographical_coverage: 'Canada and provinces' 
computation_calculations: "The gender wage ratio is the wage for women divided by the wage for men. Alternatively, the gender wage ratio can be subtracted from one and then multiplied by 100, such that it represents, when positive, how much less women earn than men in percentage terms (or, in the case of a negative percentage, how much more women earn than men)."
