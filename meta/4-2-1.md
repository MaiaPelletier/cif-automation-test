national_indicator_description: “This indicator measures attainment rate for post-secondary education. Categories represent the highest level of education achieved, and are mutually exclusive.”
national_geographical_coverage: 'Canada, Provinces & Territories'
computation_calculations: 'The data are based on a 12-month average from January to December.'

comments_limitations: “Caution should be exercised in interpreting the provincial/territorial ratios and differences in ratios between provinces/territories and over time, as small estimates may present fairly high sampling variability. Estimates for small geographic areas, for small age groups or for cross-classified variables will be associated with larger variability.”
