national_indicator_description: "Breathing in air pollutants can contribute to health issues such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases and premature mortality. To better inform Canadians, an indicator was devised that monitors general improvements to air quality using the 2020 Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS, the standards). More specifically, this indicator tracks the percentage of the population living in areas where outdoor concentrations of air pollutants were below the 2020 standards."
