national_indicator_available: "Gross domestic expenditure on research & development (GERD) intensity"
target_name: 'No specific target'
national_indicator_description: "GERD serves as a general indicator of R&D activity and not as a detailed inventory of R&D projects within an organization, sector, or province. It is an estimate and as such can show trends in R&D expenditures by sector and sub-sector, by province and country, from year-to-year. In this capacity, the GERD estimates are sufficiently reliable for their main use as an aggregate indicator for science policy." 
national_geographical_coverage: 'Canada and provinces' 
computation_calculations: "The GERD is the aggregate of the total R&D expenditures of the performing sectors. There are four major sectors of R&D performance and five for funding: Government; Business enterprise; Higher education; Private non-profit organizations; Foreign (funding only)."
