For the analysis of cyber-related violations, one distinct violation within the incident was identified as the 'cybercrime violation'. The cybercrime violation represents the specific criminal violation within an incident in which a computer or the internet was the target of the crime, or the instrument used to commit the crime. For the majority of incidents, the cybercrime violation and the most serious violation were the same."
