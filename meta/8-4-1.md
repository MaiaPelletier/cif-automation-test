national_indicator_description: 'This indicator measures the proportion of involuntary part-time workers. The rate of involuntary part-time workers can be derived in different ways. The one used for this indicator is based on all involuntary part-time workers, whether they looked for full-time work or not. The rate is then presented as the number of involuntary part-timers as a share of the part-time employed.'
national_geographical_coverage: 'Canada (excluding territories) and provinces'

rationale_interpretation: "Involuntary part-time is a characteristic of underemployment and precarious employment, it is therefore an important measure to understand the experience of Canadians in the labour market and ensure that we can measure whether they have access to quality jobs."
