national_indicator_description: " Sea ice is a prominent feature in the Northern Canadian Waters.  It consists of seasonal ice that forms and melts each year (referred to as first-year ice) and ice that is present all-year round (referred to as multi-year ice). The amount and type of sea ice present, and the total minimum area it covers during the summer season,  impacts human activity and biological habitat. (definition from ECCC)"
national_geographical_coverage: ' Northern Canadian Waters '
computation_calculations: " The Sea ice in Canada indicators use the weekly sea ice charts produced by the Canadian Ice Service. Weekly sea ice charts are primarily produced using imagery from RADARSAT-1 (since 1996) and RADARSAT-2 (since 2008) satellites. Other remote sensing data sources are also used, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and Moderate-Resolution Imagine Spectrometer imagery. Where possible, the interpretation of satellite data is verified using observations from the Canadian Ice Service specialists onboard dedicated aircraft and Canadian Coast Guard ships.(ECCC)
For more information regarding the methodology, please consult the ‘Data sources and methods’ section in the data source."
computation_units: Millions of square kilometers
comments_limitations: " Care should be taken when using these indicators as proxies of the actual sea ice area change in specific locations. Sea ice area change could vary considerably within a sub-region, the smallest unit of analysis in these indicators. (ECCC)"
rationale_interpretation: " Sea ice is an indicator of how the climate is changing. It is a critical component of our planet because it influences the Arctic and global climate, ecosystems, and people who live in the polar regions. Sea ice influences the climate through the sea ice–albedo feedback effect (or reflectivity of the Earth's surface). Changes in sea ice can also affect ocean currents and the exchange of heat and water vapour from the ocean to the atmosphere.
Sea ice affects marine transportation, commercial fishing, offshore resource development, the hunting and fishing patterns of Indigenous peoples, and tourism and recreation. Understanding how Canada's climate is changing is important for developing adaptive responses. The Sea ice in Canada indicators provide a way to communicate to Canadians how the coverage of Canada's Arctic sea ice has changed. (ECCC)"
