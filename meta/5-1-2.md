comments_limitations: " The Survey of Safety in Public and Private Spaces used a two-step question in order to ask respondents their sex at birth and their gender. This report is based on respondentsâ€™ gender; data on experiences of intimate partner violence among the transgender and non-binary population are not presented due to small sample size. "
rationale_interpretation: " Due to its widespread prevalence and its far-ranging immediate and long-term consequences for victims, their families, and for communities as a whole, IPV is considered a major public health problem (World Health Organization 2017). "
