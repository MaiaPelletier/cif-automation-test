national_indicator_description: "This indicator track the median number of days elapsed from first appearance to final

national_geographical_coverage: 'Canada, Province or territory'
computation_calculations: "A case is one or more charges against an accused person or company, which were processed by the courts at the same time 
(date of offence, date of initiation, date of first appearance, or date of decision), and received a final decision. The definition attempts to reflect court processing. 
All data have been processed using this case definition. Elapsed times are calculated based on the number of days it takes to complete a case, from first appearance to final 
decision. The median is the point at which half of all cases had longer case lengths and half had shorter case lengths. Excludes cases in which the case length was unknown."
comments_limitations: "Sex is determined on the basis of the accused's name in Quebec, producing a relatively higher rate of sex unknown. 
Information on the sex of the accused is not available from Manitoba."
