# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: <p>This indicator measures the proportion of household that lives in core housing need.</p><p><b>Core housing</b> need refers to whether a private household's housing falls below at least one of the indicator thresholds for housing adequacy, affordability or suitability, and would have to spend 30% or more of its total before-tax income to pay the median rent of alternative local housing that is acceptable (attains all three housing indicator thresholds).</p><p><b>Unaffordable housing</b> has shelter costs equal to 30% or more of total before-tax household income.</p><p><b>Unsuitable housing</b> does not have enough bedrooms for the size and composition of resident households according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS).</p><p><b>Inadequate housing</b> is reported by their residents as requiring major repairs.</p>

computation_calculations: Number of households in core housing need divided by all
  households for each category.

comments_limitations: <p>The target population is the population of Canada's 10 provinces
  excluding residents of institutions, members of the Canadian Forces living in military
  camps and people living on Indian reserves.</p><p>Given that the non-binary population
  is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is sometimes necessary
  to protect the confidentiality of responses provided. In these cases, individuals
  in the category "non-binary person" are distributed into the other two gender categories
  and the categories are denoted by the + symbol.</p><p>"Men+" includes men and boys,
  as well as some non-binary persons. "Women+" includes women and girls, as well as
  some non-binary persons.</p>
