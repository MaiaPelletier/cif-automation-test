# Indicator definition and additional information

national_indicator_description: "The indicator compares harvest rates with established harvest limits. These limits are based on scientific information, providing a direct measure of whether we are managing the use of these resources within ecosystem limits. It is one measure of fishing pressure on wild fish stocks. <em>(ECCC)</em>"

computation_calculations: 'The indicator compares harvest rates with harvest limits. These limits are based on scientific information and provide a direct measure of whether we are managing the use of these resources within ecosystem limits. The indicator is a simple tabulation of stocks based on whether harvest levels are within removal reference levels, within other harvest limits, or over harvest limits. <em>(ECCC)</em>'

rationale_interpretation: "The preservation of the ecological, social and economic value of fish stocks requires limiting harvest. Overfishing and other pressures can reduce the size and productivity of fish stocks, and in the past have even led to their collapse. The harvest rate is the proportion of the stock that is taken from the water, either intentionally or as bycatch. Harvest rates must be adjusted to reflect changing conditions and to protect stocks for the future. <em>(ECCC)</em>"

comments_limitations: "The Sustainability Survey for Fisheries (the survey) is completed with the best available information. Since the oceans are wide and deep, and fish move between habitats, their populations are difficult to monitor. The survey summarizes information across a wide variety of species, management regimes, types of fisheries, geographic regions, and socio-economic contexts. Small changes in the set of surveyed stocks occur due to changes in the way stocks are assessed or managed. Results should be interpreted with this in mind. The indicator does not account for fished stocks that do not meet the criteria for major stocks. Seaweeds and other aquatic plants are also excluded. <em>(ECCC)</em>"
