# Additional information

national_indicator_description: "These indicators report the amount and proportion of Canada's terrestrial (land and freshwater) and marine area that is conserved. <em>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)</em>"

computation_calculations: 'The area conserved is estimated by means of a geographical analysis based on reported boundaries, accounting for overlaps. <em>(ECCC)</em>'

comments_limitations: "<p>Land and/or water access and use within protected areas are controlled primarily for the purpose of conserving nature (for example, a park, a conservation area or a wildlife reserve). Other effective area-based conservation measures are also managed over the long term in ways that result in the effective conservation of biodiversity. However, they might have been established for other purposes. <br><br>Comparisons with previous reports should be made with caution, as data quality and completeness continue to improve. Privately protected land and other effective area-based conservation measures contribute to achievement of Canada's targets, but many are not yet captured within the database. <em>(ECCC)</em></p>"
