target_name: 'No specific target'
national_indicator_description: "The Crime Severity Index (CSI) measures changes in the level of severity of crime in Canada from year to year. In the index, all crimes are assigned a weight based on their seriousness. The level of seriousness is based on actual sentences handed down by the courts in all provinces and territories. More serious crimes are assigned higher weights, less serious offences lower weights. As a result, more serious offences have a greater impact on changes in the index. The PRCSI is standardized to 100 in base year 2006."
national_geographical_coverage: 'Canada, Province or territory'
computation_calculations: "The crime severity index includes all Criminal Code violations including traffic, as well as drug violations and all Federal Statutes."
comments_limitations: "The Youth Crime Severity Index is based on the same principles as the Overall Crime Severity Index, which reflects the relative seriousness of different offences, but uses the number of youths accused instead of an incident count."
