target_name: 'No specific target'
national_indicator_description: "This indicator measures the Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient is a number between zero and one that measures the relative degree of inequality in the distribution of income."
national_geographical_coverage: 'Canada (excluding territories) and provinces' 
computation_calculations: "The Gini coefficient would register zero (minimum inequality) for a population in which each person received exactly the same adjusted household income and it would register a coefficient of one (maximum inequality) if one person received all the adjusted household income and the rest received none."
comments_limitations: "It covers all individuals in Canada, excluding persons living on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements in the provinces, the institutionalized population, and households in extremely remote areas with very low population density. Overall, these exclusions amount to less than 2 percent of the population."
rationale_interpretation: "Even though a single Gini coefficient value has no simple interpretation, comparisons of the level over time or between populations are very straightforward: the higher the coefficient, the higher the inequality of the distribution."
