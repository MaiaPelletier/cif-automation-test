national_indicator_available: Incidence of opioid and stimulant overdose related harms
target_name: Reduction from the previous year in the incidence of opioid and stimulant
  overdose related harms

national_indicator_description: '<p>This indicator measures the incidence of opioid
  and stimulant overdose related harms. More specifically, it measures the incidence
  of: <br><br> 1. apparent opioid and stimulant toxicity deaths;<br> 2. opioid-related
  and stimulant-related poisoning hospitalizations; and<br> 3. Emergency Medical Services
  (EMS) responses to suspected opioid overdoses</p>'
national_geographical_coverage: Canada, provinces and territories

computation_calculations: '<p>Apparent opioid toxicity death (AOTD): A death caused
  by intoxication/toxicity (poisoning) resulting from substance use, where one or
  more of the substances is an opioid, regardless of how it was obtained (e.g. illegally
  or through personal prescription). Other substances may also be involved. <br><br>Apparent
  stimulant toxicity death (ASTD): A death caused by intoxication/toxicity (poisoning)
  resulting from substance use, where one or more of the substances is a stimulant,
  regardless of how it was obtained (e.g. illegally or through personal prescription).
  Other substances may also be involved. <br><br>Opioid-related poisoning hospitalization:
  Acute care hospitalizations that recorded a significant diagnosis for opioid-related
  poisoning. <br><br>Stimulant-related poisoning hospitalization: Acute care hospitalizations
  that recorded a significant diagnosis for stimulant-related poisoning. <br><br>Emergency
  Medical Services (EMS) responses to suspected opioid overdoses: There is currently
  no national case definition for suspected opioid-related overdoses attended by EMS.
  Therefore, each region reports data based on their respective provincial or territorial
  case definition. Counts are provided by the provinces and territories that collect
  data from their respective Emergency Medical Services. The data provided by the
  provinces and territories include EMS responses to suspected overdoses: <br>- where
  naloxone was administered by a member of the Emergency Medical Services or a bystander
  on site, or <br>- where naloxone was not necessarily administered but an opioid-related
  overdose was suspected. <br><br>Data on opioid-related and stimulant-related poisoning
  hospitalizations are not mutually exclusive. A proportion of poisoning hospitalizations
  involving a stimulant also involved an opioid. Adding up those numbers would result
  in an overestimation of the burden of opioids and stimulants.</p>'

comments_limitations: Data from Quebec are excluded from the hospitalization rate.
