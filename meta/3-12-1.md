national_indicator_available: 'Incidence of opioid and stimulant overdose related harms'
target_name: "Reduction from the previous year in the incidence of opioid and stimulant overdose related harms"

national_indicator_description: "<p>This indicator measures the incidence of opioid and stimulant overdose related harms per 100,000 population. More specifically, it measures the incidence of: <br>
  1. apparent opiod toxicity deaths;<br>
  2. opioid-related and stimulant-related poisoning hospitalizations; and<br>
  3. Emergency Medical Services responses to suspected opioid overdoses</p>"
  
national_geographical_coverage: 'Canada'

computation_calculations: "<p>Apparent opioid toxicity death (AOTD): A death caused by intoxication/toxicity (poisoning) resulting from substance use, where one or more of the substances is an opioid. Other substances may also be involved. Data on apparent opioid toxicity deaths and stimulant toxicity deaths are not mutually exclusive. A high proportion of deaths involving a stimulant also involved an opioid. Adding up those numbers would result in an overestimation of the burden of opioids and stimulants. <br><br>Data on opioid-related and stimulant-related poisoning hospitalizations are not mutually exclusive. A proportion of poisoning hospitalizations involving a stimulant also involved an opioid. Adding up those numbers would result in an overestimation of the burden of opioids and stimulants.</p>"

comments_limitations: "Data for 2020 are for January to September. Data from Quebec are excluded from the hospitalization rate."
