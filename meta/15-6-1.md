target_name: "No specific target"
national_indicator_description: "These indicators provide a measure of the ability of river water across Canada to support plants and animals. At each monitoring site, specific water quality data are compared to water quality guidelines to create a rating for the site. If measured water quality remains within the guidelines, it can maintain a healthy ecosystem.
Water quality at a monitoring site is considered excellent when parameters in a river almost always meet their guidelines. Conversely, water quality is rated poor when parameters usually do not meet their guidelines, sometimes by a wide margin. (ECCC)"
national_geographical_coverage: 'Canada and regions'
computation_calculations: "Water quality is reported in these indicators by measuring a number of chemical and physical properties (parameters) in water. The results for each parameter are compared to its water quality guideline. (ECCC)"
computation_units: Percentage or unit
comments_limitations: "These indicators reflect the state of water quality in rivers in southern Canada. Northern Canada is under-represented.
The indicators only use data for a subset of variables where guidelines exist. They do not cover all potential water quality issues in Canada.
The indicators are based on the impacts of a number of parameters at each site. These concentrations do not show the effect of spills or other transient events unless samples were collected right after the spill happened or their effect on water quality is long-lasting. (ECCC)"
rationale_interpretation: "Clean freshwater is an essential resource. It protects aquatic plant and animal biodiversity. We use it for manufacturing, energy production, irrigation, swimming, boating, fishing and for domestic use (for example, drinking, washing). Degraded water quality damages the health of all freshwater ecosystems, such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs and wetlands. It can also disrupt fisheries, tourism and agriculture, and make it more expensive to treat to drinking water standards.
These indicators provide information about the state of surface water quality and its change through time, to support water resource management. (ECCC)"
