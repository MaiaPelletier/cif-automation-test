# Indicator definition and additioanl information

national_indicator_description: "The indicator shows whether population and distribution trends of species at risk are consistent with the objectives in final recovery strategies or management plans. <em>(ECCC)</em>"

computation_calculations: "Population and distribution trend information for each species is compared to its objectives to determine whether it is on track to meet those objectives. Each species is assigned to 1 of 4 categories based on whether it is making progress toward objectives: yes, no, mixed evidence, or insufficient information. The indicator is a count of the number of species in the yes, no or mixed evidence categories. <em>(ECCC)</em>"

rationale_interpretation: "The indicator provides a preliminary assessment of whether recovery or management efforts are on track. Species at risk are important elements of healthy ecosystems, and are protected to support biodiversity. In general, successful recovery or management of species at risk should stop or reverse significant declines due to human activity and should improve or stabilize the likelihood of the species' persistence in the wild. <em>(ECCC)</em>"

comments_limitations: "Results should not be interpreted as a measure of recovery or management success until sufficient time has passed to allow species to respond and to allow enough information to be collected to assess the recovery or management. <em>(ECCC)</em>"
