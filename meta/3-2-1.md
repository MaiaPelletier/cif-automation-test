national_indicator_available: "Percentage of Canadians (aged 15+) who are current cigarette smokers"
target_name: "By 2035, less than 5% of Canadians (aged 15+) are cigarette smokers"
national_indicator_description: "This indicator measures the percentage of Canadians who are current cigarette smokers"
national_geographical_coverage: 'Canada (excluding territories) and province' 
computation_calculations: "Daily smoker refers to those who reported smoking cigarettes every day. Occasional smoker refers to those who reported smoking cigarettes occasionally. This includes former daily smokers who now smoke occasionally."
comments_limitations: "Due to data availability, the indicator currently only measures the proportion of Canadians (aged 12+) who are cigarette smokers and not ones (aged 15+). The indicator does not take into account the number of cigarettes smoked. The indicator covers the population 12 years of age and over living in the ten provinces. Excluded from the survey's coverage are: persons living on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements; the institutionalized population, and children aged 12-17 that are living in foster care."
rationale_interpretation: "Smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, chronic respiratory disease, and other conditions. According to the World Health Organization, smoking is an important and preventable cause of death."
