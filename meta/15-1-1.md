national_indicator_description: "Canada supports a remarkable diversity of life. About 80 000 species are known to exist in Canada, excluding bacteria and viruses. However, wild species face a variety of threats, including the loss, fragmentation and degradation of habitat; pollution; overexploitation; and fishery bycatch and other incidental loss due to resource harvesting."
national_geographical_coverage: 'Canada'
computation_calculations: "National extinction risk levels are an assessment of the likelihood that a species will disappear from Canada (become extirpated). Risk levels are based on the rarity of the species, recent trends in population size and distribution, and the threats that are present. The proportion of assessed species in each risk category is reported. Also reported is the proportion of species for which the extinction risk is known versus the total number of known species.Footnote4 Species that are not native to Canada are labelled as exotic and not assessed for extinction risk."
comments_limitations:
rationale_interpretation: "The indicators provide a measure of extinction risk and an indication of the overall state of biodiversity in Canada, since the loss of a species is a loss of biodiversity. The leading cause of biodiversity loss in Canada and around the world is the loss of habitat to human development. Direct threats such as habitat loss and overharvest can be mitigated through actions such as habitat protection and harvest regulation. Wild species also face the indirect effects of human activities, including invasive species, new diseases, and climate change. Exotic species can become invasive and alter how ecosystems function."
