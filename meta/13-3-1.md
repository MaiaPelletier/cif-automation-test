national_indicator_available: 'Spring snow cover extent'
target_name: "No specific target "
national_indicator_description: " The indicators show how Canada's snow cover is changing from year-to-year and over time. The indicators report spring snow cover extent and annual snow cover duration. Snow cover extent is the area of land with snow on the ground. (definition from ECCC)"
national_geographical_coverage: 'Canada'
computation_calculations: "The Snow cover extent indicator is based on the monthly mean snow extent values derived from 5 datasets: NOAA Snow Chart Climate Data Record, Crocus, MERRA-2, GlobSnow-3 and Brown.(ECCC)
For more information regarding the methodology, please consult the ‘Data sources and methods’ section in the data source."
computation_units: Millions of square kilometers
comments_limitations: "The identification of terrestrial snow cover from visible satellite data is heavily influenced by anything that obscures the surface, such as darkness, cloud cover or dense forest. Increased frequency of visible satellite coverage over time, as well as all-weather snow cover information from passive microwave satellites, means that our ability to detect and map snow is now much better than in the early part of the data record. (ECCC)"
rationale_interpretation: " Snow cover extent is closely linked to air temperature, which means it has a strong seasonal cycle, and varies from year-to-year. Spring snow cover trends are of significant interest because of the wide range of impacts (for example, hydrology, ecosystems and wildfire risk) and because positive feedbacks in the climate system are strongest during this season. (ECCC)"
