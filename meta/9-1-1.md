national_indicator_available: 'Proportion of technology innovation related to the environment'
target_name: No specific target
national_indicator_description: "The indicator calculates the proportion of patents in environment-related technology out of total patents."
national_geographical_coverage: 'Canada'
computation_calculations: 'A five-year moving average was used to smooth for election and policy impacts that could affect the data during a specific year.'
computation_units: Percentage
comments_limitations: "Patents are subject to certain drawbacks: the value distribution of patents is skewed as many patents have no industrial application (and hence are of little value to society) whereas a few are of substantial value; many inventions are not patented because they are not patentable or inventors may protect the inventions using other methods, such as secrecy, lead time, etc.; the propensity to patent differs across countries and industries; differences in patent regulations make it difficult to compare counts across countries; and changes in patent law over the years make it difficult to analyse trends over time. (OECD Stat)"
rationale_interpretation: 'Patents are a key measure of innovation output, as patent indicators reflect the inventive performance of countries, regions, technologies, firms, etc. They are also used to track the level of diffusion of knowledge across technology areas, countries, sectors, firms, etc., and the level of internationalisation of innovative activities. Patent indicators can serve to measure the output of R&D, its productivity, structure and the development of a specific technology/industry. (OECD Stat)'
