national_indicator_available: "Proportion of households that have access to broadband Internet service at speeds of 50 Mbps for downloads / 10 Mbps for uploads and unlimited data"
target_name: "By 2026, 98% Canadian homes and small businesses have access to speeds of 50 Mbps download / 10 Mbps upload, with the goal of connecting all Canadians to these speeds by 2030."
national_indicator_description: "This indicator measures the proportion of households that have access to broadband internet service at speeds of 50 Mbps for downloads / 10 Mbps for uploads and unlimited data." 
national_geographical_coverage: 'Canada' 
computation_calculations: "Small population centres are considered to have populations of between 1,000 and 29,999. Medium population centres are considered to have populations of between 30,000 and 99,999. Large population centres are considered to have populations greater than 100,000. Rural areas have populations of less than 1,000, or fewer than 400 people per square kilometre."
comments_limitations: "Not applicable"
rationale_interpretation: "The CRTC identifies that a well-developed broadband infrastructure is essential for Canadians to participate in the digital economy. While most Canadians today have access to these minimum service levels, many rural and remote regions in Canada lack the infrastructure needed."
