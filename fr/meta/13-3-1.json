In 2016, climate change adaptation was defined as anticipating or monitoring climate change and undertaking actions to address the consequences of climate change.<br> Climate change is a long-term shift in weather conditions identified by changes in temperature, precipitation, winds, and other indicators. Climate change can involve both changes in average conditions and changes in variability, including for example, extreme events.</p>","computation_calculations":"Number of municipal organization who factored climate change in their decision making divided by total number of municipal organization owning the infrastructure asset.","rationale_interpretation":"In Canada, emergency management adopts an all-hazards approach to address both natural and human-induced hazards and disasters. These are increasing in both number and frequency across the world, resulting in ever growing human suffering and economic cost. Canada is not immune to these events. Natural and human-induced hazards and disasters have become more prevalent in urban and rural communities. In addition, scientists predict that climate change will continue to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heat waves, heavy rainfalls and related flooding, droughts, forest fires, serious winter storms, hurricanes and tornados; that may increasingly strain emergency management capacities and budgets across Canada. These events can have profoundly negative effects on Canadians.<em>(An Emergency Management Framework for Canada - Third Edition.
