Suitable housing has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of resident households according to National Occupancy Standard requirements.</p>","comments_limitations":" Only private, non-farm, non-reserve and owner- or renter-households with incomes greater than zero and shelter-cost-to-income ratios less than 100% are assessed for \u2018core housing need.\u2019 Non-family households with at least one maintainer aged 15 to 29 attending school are considered not to be in \u2018core housing need\u2019 regardless of their housing circumstances.
