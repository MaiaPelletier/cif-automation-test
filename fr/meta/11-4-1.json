Almost complete coverage was obtained for the municipalities making up the 35 metropolitan cities.<br>  b) The public transit stop locations were incorporated within Statistics Canada\u2019s geographic databases containing population counts for 2016 Census Dissemination Blocks. All Dissemination Blocks located within a 500 meter radius of a transit stop were selected, and summed for the municipality. A straight-line distance is sometimes not the most direct route, but it is consistently applied to facilitate comparison across cities. This approach will produce a slight over-estimate.<br>  c) In the final step, the population living within 500 meters is divided by the total population of the entire metropolitan city.<br> The total population is used, as it provided a better indication of the true count of persons interacting socially and economically within the space of the metropolitan area, and thus potentially using public transportation.</p>","rationale_interpretation":"The ability of residents including persons with disabilities and businesses to access markets, employment opportunities, and service centers such as schools and hospitals is critical to urban economic development. The transport system provides access to resources and employment opportunity. Moreover, accessibility allows planners to measure the effects of changes in transport and land use systems. The accessibility of jobs, services and markets also allow policymakers, citizens and businesses to discuss the state of the transport system in a comprehensible way. The transportation system is a critical enabler of economic activities and social inclusion. <em>(United Nations.
