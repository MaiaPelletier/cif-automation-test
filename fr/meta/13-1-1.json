The major GHGs are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20). <em>(definition from United Nations Climate Change)</em>","computation_calculations":"<p>In general, GHG emissions are estimated by multiplying activity data by the associated emission factor.<br> Emissions = activity data \u00d7 emission factor<br> Activity data refer to the quantitative amount of human activity resulting in emissions during a given time period. The annual activity data for fuel combustion sources, for example, are the total amounts of fuel burned over a year.<br> Emission factors are based on samples of measurement data, and are representative rates of emissions for a given activity level under a given set of operating conditions. It is the estimated average emission rate of a given pollutant for a given source, relative to units of activity.<br> Guidelines produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for countries reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change provide various methods for calculating GHG emissions from a given human activity. The methods for estimating emissions are divided into 'tiers,' each encompassing different levels of activity and technological detail. The same general structure is used for all tiers, while the level of detail at which the calculations are carried out can vary.<br> Greenhouse gas emissions are reported in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2 eq), determined by multiplying the amount of emissions of a particular greenhouse gas by the global warming potential of that gas. <em>(ECCC)</em></p>","rationale_interpretation":"Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, just as the glass of a greenhouse keeps warm air inside. Human activity increases the amount of GHGs in the atmosphere, contributing to a warming of the Earth's surface. This is called the enhanced greenhouse effect. Over the past 200 years in particular, humans have released GHGs into the atmosphere primarily from burning fossil fuels. As a result, more heat is being trapped and the temperature of the planet is increasing. Sea levels are rising as the Arctic ice melts, and there are changes to the climate, such as more severe storms and heat waves. All of this impacts the environment, the economy and human health. The Greenhouse gas emissions indicators are used to track the progress of Canada's efforts to lower emissions and reach environmental performance objectives. They also support decision making on sustainable development. <em>(ECCC)</em>","comments_limitations":"The Greenhouse gas emissions indicators are comprehensive but some emission sources have not been included in the indicators because they are not reported in the National Inventory Report. Owing to their relatively small contributions to the total emissions, these excluded sources do not significantly affect the overall completeness of the inventory. A detailed explanation of the excluded emission sources can be found in Annex 5 of the National Inventory Report. Although reported in the National Inventory Report, emissions and removals from the land use, land use change and forestry sector are excluded from national totals and subsequently not reported as part of the Greenhouse gas emissions indicators. <em>(ECCC)</em>","graph_title":"Greenhouse gas emissions","graph_type":"line","graph_annotations":[{"unit":"Mt CO2 eq","value":510.82158414,"preset":"target_line"}],"data_footnote":"The 2030 target correspond to the target for Canada, National Inventory Total only","data_start_values":[{"field":"R\u00e9gion","value":"Canada"},{"field":"Source","value":"National Inventory Total"}],"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Environment and Climate Change Canada's National Inventory Report 1990-2018: Greenhouse Gas Sources and Sinks in Canada","source_url_1":"https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/greenhouse-gas-emissions.html","source_organisation_1":"Environment and Climate Change Canada","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Canada and provinces & territories","page_content":"This indicator correspond to the Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/greenhouse-gas-emissions.html\"> <em>Greenhouse gas emissions</em></a>.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-05-26: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/cif-data-donnees-cic/commit/a82e320d86dac985695928db5b5143519ce6bf4e","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-05-11: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/cif-data-donnees-cic/commit/3b9740d6e48128cfa78769f193b3e8a150eb12de","indicator":"13.1.1"}
