Risk levels are based on the rarity of the species, recent trends in population size and distribution, and the threats that are present. The proportion of assessed species in each risk category is reported. Also reported is the proportion of species for which the extinction risk is known versus the total number of known species. Species that are not native to Canada are labelled as exotic and not assessed for extinction risk. <em>(ECCC)</em>","comments_limitations":"<p>The number of species assessed in the Wild Species report series has increased from 1 670 in 2000 to 29 848 in 2015.
