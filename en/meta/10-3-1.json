These groups together represent an exclusion of less than 2% of the Canadian population aged 15 and over.","rationale_interpretation":"As stated in the Gender Results Framework from Women and Gender Equality Canada, every person should have the opportunity to reach their full potential while contributing to, and benefitting from, a strong growing economy.
