{"national_indicator_available":"Gini Coefficient","target_name":"No target","national_indicator_description":"The Gini coefficient is a number between zero and one that measures the relative degree of inequality in the distribution of income. The coefficient would register zero (minimum inequality) for a population in which each person received exactly the same adjusted household income and it would register a coefficient of one (maximum inequality) if one person received all the adjusted household income and the rest received none. Even though a single Gini coefficient value has no simple interpretation, comparisons of the level over time or between populations are very straightforward: the higher the coefficient, the higher the inequality of the distribution.","national_geographical_coverage":"Canada and provinces","computation_calculations":"Calculation","comments_limitations":"Limits","rationale_interpretation":"Rationale and interpretation go here","graph_title":"Gini coefficient of adjusted after-tax income, annual","graph_type":"line","computation_units":"Decimal","data_start_values":[{"field":"Geography","value":"Canada"}],"indicator_name":"Gini Coefficient","indicator_sort_order":"10-01-01","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","indicator_number":"10.1.1","sdg_goal":"10","data_non_statistical":false,"target_id":"10.1","data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Statistics Canada.
