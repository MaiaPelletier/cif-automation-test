Materials are those generated by all IC and I and CRD sources in a municipality, and are excluded from the residential waste stream. Residential non-hazardous recyclable materials include solid non-hazardous materials produced in all residences and include non-hazardous materials that are picked up by the municipality (either using its own staff or through contracting firms) and non-hazardous materials from residential sources that are self-hauled to depots, transfer stations and disposal facilities.","rationale_interpretation":"<p>As the importance of reducing the amount of waste disposed of in the nation's landfills becomes a more important part of the national conversation, diversion efforts are being targeted at specific materials.<br> Plastic in particular has been the subject of new policies that aim to address the presence of plastics in our oceans (<em>Ocean Plastics Charter</em>) and to reduce plastics in our environment in general, through the federal Action Plan on Zero Plastic Waste.<br> Municipalities across Canada have taken steps in recent years to reduce the amount of organic waste disposed of in landfills. In landfills, organic waste breaks down in a low- to no-oxygen environment that produces methane\u2014a gas with about 20 times the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide.<br> Extended producer responsibility agreements incentivize producers to manufacture their goods with end-of-life management in mind. These types of arrangements helped to promote the diversion of electronic products from Canada's landfills.</p>","comments_limitations":"This information covers only those companies and local waste management organizations that reported non-hazardous recyclable material preparation activities and refers only to that material entering the waste stream and does not cover any waste that may be managed on-site by a company or household. Additionally, these data do not include those materials transported by the generator directly to secondary processors, such as pulp and paper mills, while bypassing entirely any firm or local government involved in waste management activities. Residential and non-residential splits are not available at the total level, as electronic and tire source data are unavailable.","graph_title":"Total waste diversion per capita","graph_type":"bar","data_start_values":[{"field":"Geography","value":"Canada"},{"field":"Type of materials diverted","value":"All materials diverted"},{"field":"Sources of materials prepared for recycling","value":"All sources of diverted materials"}],"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Statistics Canada.
