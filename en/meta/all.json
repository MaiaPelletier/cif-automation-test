Almost complete coverage was obtained for the municipalities making up the 35 metropolitan cities. b) The public transit stop locations were incorporated within Statistics Canada\u2019s geographic databases containing population counts for 2016 Census Dissemination Blocks. All Dissemination Blocks located within a 500 meter radius of a transit stop were selected, and summed for the municipality. A straight-line distance is sometimes not the most direct route, but it is consistently applied to facilitate comparison across cities. This approach will produce a slight over-estimate. c) In the final step, the population living within 500 meters is divided by the total population of the entire metropolitan city.

Emission factors are based on samples of measurement data, and are representative rates of emissions for a given activity level under a given set of operating conditions. It is the estimated average emission rate of a given pollutant for a given source, relative to units of activity. Guidelines produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for countries reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change provide various methods for calculating GHG emissions from a given human activity. The methods for estimating emissions are divided into 'tiers,' each encompassing different levels of activity and technological detail. The same general structure is used for all tiers, while the level of detail at which the calculations are carried out can vary.

Owing to their relatively small contributions to the total emissions, these excluded sources do not significantly affect the overall completeness of the inventory. A detailed explanation of the excluded emission sources can be found in Annex 5 of the National Inventory Report. Although reported in the National Inventory Report, emissions and removals from the land use, land use change and forestry sector are excluded from national totals and subsequently not reported as part of the Greenhouse gas emissions indicators.

Human activity increases the amount of GHGs in the atmosphere, contributing to a warming of the Earth's surface. This is called the enhanced greenhouse effect. Over the past 200 years in particular, humans have released GHGs into the atmosphere primarily from burning fossil fuels. As a result, more heat is being trapped and the temperature of the planet is increasing. Sea levels are rising as the Arctic ice melts, and there are changes to the climate, such as more severe storms and heat waves. All of this impacts the environment, the economy and human health.

It is a SAS based application for producing estimates (totals, ratios, percentages) for domains of a population based on a sample.\nAn initial sampling weight (the design weight) is calculated for each unit in the survey and is the inverse of the probability of selection. The weight calculated for each sampling unit indicates how many other units it represents. Sampling units which are selected with certainty (must-take units) have sampling weights of one and only represent themselves; outlier units with larger than expected size are seen as misclassified and their weight is usually adjusted so that they only represent themselves, and the weights of other units are adjusted accordingly to take into account the existence of outliers. The final weights are usually either one or greater than one.\nEstimates are computed at several levels of interest such as the North American Industry Classification System code and region or province, based on the most recent classification information for the statistical entity and the survey reference period.
