Natural and human-induced hazards and disasters have become more prevalent in urban and rural communities. In addition, scientists predict that climate change will continue to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heat waves, heavy rainfalls and related flooding, droughts, forest fires, serious winter storms, hurricanes and tornados; that may increasingly strain emergency management capacities and budgets across Canada. These events can have profoundly negative effects on Canadians.<em>(An Emergency Management Framework for Canada - Third Edition.
