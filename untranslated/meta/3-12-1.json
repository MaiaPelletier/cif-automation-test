{"national_indicator_available":"Incidence of opioid and stimulant overdose related harms","target_name":"Reduction from the previous year in the incidence of opioid and stimulant overdose related harms","national_indicator_description":"<p>This indicator measures the incidence of opioid and stimulant overdose related harms per 100,000 population. More specifically, it measures the incidence of: <br> 1. apparent opiod toxicity deaths;<br> 2. opioid-related and stimulant-related poisoning hospitalizations; and<br> 3. Emergency Medical Services responses to suspected opioid overdoses</p>","national_geographical_coverage":"Canada","computation_calculations":"Apparent opioid toxicity death (AOTD): A death caused by intoxication/toxicity (poisoning) resulting from substance use, where one or more of the substances is an opioid. Other substances may also be involved. Data on apparent opioid toxicity deaths and stimulant toxicity deaths are not mutually exclusive. A high proportion of deaths involving a stimulant also involved an opioid. Adding up those numbers would result in an overestimation of the burden of opioids and stimulants. Data on opioid-related and stimulant-related poisoning hospitalizations are not mutually exclusive. A proportion of poisoning hospitalizations involving a stimulant also involved an opioid. Adding up those numbers would result in an overestimation of the burden of opioids and stimulants.","comments_limitations":"Data for 2020 are for January to September. Data from Quebec are excluded from the hospitalization rate.","rationale_interpretation":"The COVID-19 outbreak is worsening the already deadly and ongoing public health crisis of opioid overdoses and death. It is having a tragic impact on people who use substances, their families, and communities across Canada. People who use substances, such as opioids, cocaine, and methamphetamine, are experiencing a number of increased risks, with several jurisdictions reporting higher rates of fatal overdoses and other harms.","graph_title":"Incidence of opioid and stimulant related overdose harms per 100,000 population","graph_type":"line","computation_units":"number per 100,000 population","data_start_values":[{"field":"Deaths or hospitalizations","value":"Hospitalizations"},{"field":"Deaths or hospitalizations","value":"Deaths"}],"indicator_name":"Incidence of opioid and stimulant overdose related harms","indicator_sort_order":"03-12-01","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","indicator_number":"3.12.1","sdg_goal":"3","data_non_statistical":false,"target_id":"3.12","data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Opioid- and Stimulant-related Harms in Canada","source_url_1":"https://health-infobase.canada.ca/substance-related-harms/opioids-stimulants","source_organisation_1":"Public Health Agency of Canada","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Canada","page_content":"","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-05-31: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/cif-data-donnees-cic/commit/68dd2c2bd0d68f03e620f23e4dbdb1e46a1d604c","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-05-11: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/cif-data-donnees-cic/commit/3b9740d6e48128cfa78769f193b3e8a150eb12de","indicator":"3.12.1"}
