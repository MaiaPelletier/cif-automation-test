Habitat conservation is a measure of human response to the loss of biodiversity and natural habitat. As the area conserved in Canada increases, more lands and waters are withdrawn from direct human development stresses, thereby contributing to biodiversity conservation and improving the health of ecosystems. In turn, healthy ecosystems provide benefits such as clean water, mitigation of climate change, pollination and improved human health. <em>(ECCC)</em>","comments_limitations":"Comparisons with previous reports should be made with caution, as data quality and completeness continue to improve. Privately protected land and other effective area-based conservation measures contribute to achievement of Canada's targets, but many are not yet captured within the database. <em>(ECCC)</em>","graph_title":"Proportion of terrestrial area conserved","graph_type":"line","data_start_values":[{"field":"Geography","value":"Canada"}],"graph_annotations":[{"unit":"Percentage","value":30,"preset":"target_line"}],"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Environment and Climate Change Canada.
