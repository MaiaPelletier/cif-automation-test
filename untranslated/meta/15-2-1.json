Each species is assigned to 1 of 4 categories based on whether it is making progress toward objectives: yes, no, mixed evidence, or insufficient information. The indicator is a count of the number of species in the yes, no or mixed evidence categories. <em>(ECCC)</em>","rationale_interpretation":"The indicator provides a preliminary assessment of whether recovery or management efforts are on track. Species at risk are important elements of healthy ecosystems, and are protected to support biodiversity. In general, successful recovery or management of species at risk should stop or reverse significant declines due to human activity and should improve or stabilize the likelihood of the species' persistence in the wild. <em>(ECCC)</em>","comments_limitations":"Results should not be interpreted as a measure of recovery or management success until sufficient time has passed to allow species to respond and to allow enough information to be collected to assess the recovery or management. <em>(ECCC)</em>","graph_title":"Proportion of species at risk showing progress towards their population and distribution objectives","graph_type":"bar","data_start_values":[{"field":"Population and distribution trends consistent with objectives","value":"On track"},{"field":"Population and distribution trends consistent with objectives","value":"Mixed evidence"},{"field":"Population and distribution trends consistent with objectives","value":"Not on track"}],"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Species at risk population trends","source_url_1":"https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/species-risk-population-trends.html","source_organisation_1":"Environment and Climate Change Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Parks Canada, and the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada Secretariat","source_periodicity_1":null,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Canada","page_content":"This indicator correspond to the Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/species-risk-population-trends.html\"> <em>Species at risk population trends</em></a>.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-05-26: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/cif-data-donnees-cic/commit/9be67c702af38d28e8e7c251fc567ceebac787ae","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-06-08: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/cif-data-donnees-cic/commit/3a0638fa2a1041e2c40ee2031db31740b7a8bb05","indicator":"15.2.1"}
